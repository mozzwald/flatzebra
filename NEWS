2012-07-14: Version 0.1.6 released

    Joystick class now supports two sticks, as well as the two
    trigger buttons. D-pad support dropped.
    Fixed bug with Joystick::getYAxisValue().
    Added squaredLength() and dotProduct() to Couple and RCouple.
    PixmapArray constructor does not require fixed array size anymore;
    the internal vector now resizes as needed.
    Put new FSF address in GPL copyright notices.
    Small fixes to compile under Visual C++ on Win32.
    RPM spec file rewritten using Fedora template.
    (RPM spec file now compatible with /usr/lib64 directory.)

2010-05-16: Version 0.1.5 released

    Added support for toggling between full screen mode and
    window mode.
    Centralized pixel, line and filled rectangle drawing
    functions that were previously in Cosmosmash.
    Added version of writeStringXCentered() that accepts
    a vertical position and centers the string with respect
    to the whole screen width.
    Centralized Xbox 360 USB controller code that was
    previously in some flatzebra-based games.
    Fixed compilation warnings to satisfy gcc's -Weffc++ option.

2010-03-30: Version 0.1.4 released

    New GameEngine constructor argument: processActiveEvent.
    New virtual function: processActivation().
    Together, they allow a game to go to pause when it loses
    focus or is iconified.
    In full screen mode, the mouse pointer is now disabled.

2009-06-21: Version 0.1.3 released

    Fixed SDL_LIBS in configure.ac so that "-lSDL_image -lSDL_mixer"
    will be inserted in the dependency_libs field of the installed
    .la file. The flatzebra shared library will also specify
    SDL_image and SDL_mixer as being needed (according to ldd).

    Fixed compilation warnings.

2009-02-26: Version 0.1.2 released

    Pixmap leak fixed.

    The font_13x7.xpm file now defines "const char **" arrays.
    The loadPixmap() methods now expect a "const char **" argument.

    Each Sprite instance has a unique ID across a single execution
    of the program.

    RCouple now has floor() and ceil() methods, and they return a
    result of type Couple, like round().

    Better error checking in SDL initialization procedure.

2004-05-02: Version 0.1.1 released

    New classes RCouple and RSprite that allow one to write games
    with coordinates in real numbers instead of integers.
    Some convenience functions have been added.
    The audio "chunk size" is now 128 bytes instead of 256, to help
    avoid delays before a sound effect is heard.

2003-06-02: Version 0.1.0 released

    New name to reform the version numbers.

    The library is now defined in the `flatzebra' C++ namespace.

    There is no flatzebra.m4 anymore.  Use pkg-config with
    'flatzebra-1.0' as the module name.

    Sound mixer class added.  Key state class added.

    SDL_HWSURFACE not used anymore when setting up full screen mode:
    it has been reported to cause much flickering under Mac OS X,
    and it does not seem to be required under GNU/Linux anyway.
    Cleanup of makefiles.

2002-04-03: gengameng 4.1 released

    Library now comes with a "dynamic" gengameng-config script that
    replaces the "static" gengamengConf.sh script.  The latter takes
    the options --version, --cflags, --libs and --help, in a manner
    similar to sdl-config.

    There is a homegrown sdl_image.m4 in macros/ that tries to link
    with the SDL_image library, which is needed in addition to SDL.
    SDL_image is available at <http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/>.

    These changes do not affect the binary interface of the library.
    This is why only the minor version number has increased.

2001-11-25: gengameng 4.0 released

    Programs that use this library should use an #include directive
    of this form:

        #include <gengameng/GameEngine.h>

    instead of:

        #include <GameEngine.h>

    Those programs will thus better document which headers are taken
    for this library.

2001-04-27: gengameng 3.0 released

    This version now uses SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/).

2001-03-24: gengameng 2.1 started

    The statement

        #include "PixmapLoadError.h"

    was added in src/GameEngine.h to make this file compile under
    RedHat 7.0, which uses g++ 2.96.  I use g++ 2.95.2 under
    RedHat 6.2.

    Also, gengameng 2.1 does not link with libXaw nor libXmu anymore.
    Preceding versions used superfluous -l directives.

    The library's interface does not change because of this,
    so only the "release" number is incremented.

2001-03-13: gengameng 2.0 released

    Version 2.0 avoids polling the keyboard with XQueryKeymap()
    and expects instead to be informed of key state changes upon
    KeyPress and KeyRelease events.  See xtmain.cc in BurgerSpace
    for an example of how to get those events and how to transmit
    the information to the game engine.

    This change seems to solve some of the problems of people who
    reported that the game did not receive any keyboard input.
    However, there are still reports of similar problems.
